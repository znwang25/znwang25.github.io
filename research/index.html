                This paper investigates a question central to the long-standing debates on federalism and decentralization: how does decentralized decision-making distort the governments’ incentives to internalize border spillovers, and what are the associated economic and welfare consequences? We attempt to answer these questions by exploiting the “township merger program” in China, where thousands of pairs of neighboring townships were required to merge over the last two decades. Collecting novel firm-level geocoded emission and production panel datasets, and exploiting more than 3000 cases of township mergers between 2002 and 2008, we find evidence that local governments are internalizing spillovers on the merging borders. Empirical results show that when a polluting firm suddenly “moves” from the border to the center of the town, it receives lower government subsidies, faces higher de facto tax rates, and at the same time reduces pollutant emissions and invests more in emission abatement equipment. Utilizing another transaction-level dataset containing the universe of land auctions in China, we observe that both land prices and new developments of residential buildings increase near the merging borders with polluting firms, indicating that household welfare increases with the internalization of border pollution.

                Do bureaucrats perform better or worse working in their home city? Using the fact that Chinese mayors are often assigned to serve multiple cities in their careers, I estimate a fix effects model to study the effects of serving in home city on mayors&#39; performance. Preliminary results show that mayors collect more local tax revenue while serving in their home cities as opposed to serving else place. They also increase spending on infrastructure but reducing spending in other areas such as health and education and police and safety. This results seem to be aligned with the local capture theory and are consistent with results from other papers on this topic.

                Has there been meaningful movement toward open science practices within the social sciences in recent years? Discussions about changes in practices such as posting data and pre-registering analyses have been marked by controversy—including controversy over the extent to which change has taken place. This study, based on the State of Social Science (3S) Survey, provides the first comprehensive assessment of awareness of, attitudes towards, perceived norms regarding, and adoption of open science practices within a broadly representative sample of scholars from four major social science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. We observe a steep increase in adoption: as of 2017, over 80% of scholars had used at least one such practice, rising from one quarter a decade earlier. Attitudes toward research transparency are on average similar between older and younger scholars, but the pace of change differs by field and methodology. According with theories of normal science and scientific change, the timing of increases in adoption coincides with technological innovations and institutional policies. Patterns are consistent with most scholars underestimating the trend toward open science in their discipline.

                Nowadays, it is popular in the internet industry to train machine learning algorithms offline based on optimization objectives or evaluation metrics (offline metrics) and assess their business impacts via online randomized controlled trials for product development.  In many cases, KPIs in online experiments (online metrics) are different from offline metrics of offline-trained machine learning algorithms (e.g., gross merchandise value (GMV) vs. normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) in learning-to-rank).  It is important in practice to know how much change in the offline metric is required to achieve a certain amount of increase in the online metric. However, it is difficult to conduct controlled experiments to answer the question, because most offline metrics cannot be directly controlled online.  We address the challenge by developing a novel approach to quantify the causal relationship between offline and online metrics.  Our approach can infer marginal effects in the dose-response function of the mediator and average causal mediation effect without actually intervening it.  We model the offline and online metrics as a mediator and an outcome, respectively, and apply our approach on them.  Our approach relaxes sequential ignorability assumption and overcomes the limitation of instrumental variable in causal mediation literature. Our method only takes as inputs summary statistics of multiple past randomized experiments that can have different treatments, which makes it easy to implement in scale.
